This repository contains the source code for my personal website. 

## Overview
Simple website to showcase my skills in HTMLS, CSS, and JS. I made the designs clean and responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.  User experience is key. Also created a video player for the user in the "Lock In" tab.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (desktop & mobile).
- **Video Player:** By linking a youtube video onto the URL bar, it will play the video and save where you left if you leave in the middle of viewing the video. This could be used if you have a long video you need to grind on like the CS50 but it is to disrupting to watch normally on Youtube.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repo-name].git`
